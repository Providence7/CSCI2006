                                ================================
    One way to check if you PHP installation is correct and the server is running is to open the local host and run a PHP
    script that contains the following line of code.
                phpinfo();
    The PHP built-in phpinfo() function returns information about the current PHP installation. 
    Open the local host and navigate to this file within the local host directory system to see the PHP installation information.
